# Temperature-based-Fan-speed-control
Temperature based Fan speed control using LM35 temperature sensor and Arduino UNO.
----
This project automatically adjusts the speed of a fan based on surrounding temperature using LM35 temperature sensor and Arduino UNO. As the temperature increases, the fan speed also increases proportionally using PWM(Pulse Width Modulation).
